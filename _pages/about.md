I am an Assistant Professor at Beijing University of Technology (BJUT). I received my Ph.D. from Renmin University of China (RUC) in July 2023 and was fortunate to be advised by Prof. Yongcai Wang. 
My research interests mainly focus on intelligent networks, unmanned swarm localization, graph data mining and structure computation. My Google Scholar is: Haodi Ping.
